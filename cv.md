### Briefly About Myself:

My soft skills:<br>
- inquisitive & motivated<br>
I am truly passionate about web development. Because I love challenges, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best.<br>
- meticulous<br>
I also see myself as a highly organized person. I always take notes and use a series of tools to help myself stay on top of deadlines. I like to keep a clean workspace and create a logical filing method so I can always find what I need. I find this increases efficiency and helps the rest of the team stay on track, too. In my last group project with my study buddies, I used Agile to increase our efficiency and productivity.
- cooperative<br>
- open-minded<br>

As for my previous work experience: most of the time I worked in customer service, where I’ve overcome my social anxiety and leveled up my English while working with English-speaking clients :)

My my major goal is to become a proficient Frontend Developer and I'll do my best to achieve it!

*Given a list of colors in 6-digit hexidecimal notation #RRGGBB. Return the brightest of these colors!*

```javascript
function brightest(colors) {
  let brightestColor = colors[0];
  let brightestValue = getValue(colors[0]);
  for (let i = 1; i < colors.length; i++) {
    const color = colors[i];
    const brightness = getValue(color);
    if (brightness > brightestValue) {
      brightestColor = color;
      brightestValue = brightness;
    }
  }
  return brightestColor;

	const b = parseInt(hexColor.slice(5, 7), 16);
